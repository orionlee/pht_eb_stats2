TRUE,Eclipsing,E,F,"Eclipsing binary systems. These are binary systems with orbital planes so close to the observer's line of sight (the inclination of the orbital plane to the plane orthogonal to the line of sight is close to 90 deg.) that the components periodically eclipse each other. Consequently, the observer finds changes of the apparent combined brightness of the system with the period coincident with that of the components' orbital motion. "
TRUE,Eclipsing,EA,F,"β Persei-type (Algol) eclipsing systems. Binaries with spherical or slightly ellipsoidal components. It is possible to specify, for their light curves, the moments of the beginning and end of the eclipses. Between eclipses the light remains almost constant or varies insignificantly because of reflection effects, slight ellipsoidality of the components, or physical variations. Secondary minima may be absent. An extremely wide range of periods is observed, from 0.2 to ≥10000 days. Light amplitudes are also quite different and may reach several magnitudes. "
TRUE,Eclipsing,EB,F,"β Lyrae-type eclipsing systems. These are eclipsing systems having ellipsoidal components and light curves for which it is impossible to specify the exact times of onset and end of eclipses because of a continuous change of the system's apparent combined brightness between eclipses; secondary minimum is observed in all cases, its depth usually being considerably smaller than that of the primary minimum; periods are mainly longer than 0.5 days. The components generally belong to early spectral types (B-A). Light amplitudes are usually <2 mag. in V. "

FALSE,Rotating,ACV,F,"α2 Canum Venaticorum variables. These are main-sequence stars with spectral types B8p-A7p and displaying strong magnetic fields. Spectra show abnormally strong lines of Si, Sr, Cr, and rare earths whose intensities vary with rotation. They exhibit magnetic field and brightness changes (periods of 0.5-160 days or more). The amplitudes of the brightness changes are usually within 0.01-0.1 mag. in V. "
FALSE,Rotating,BY,F,"BY Draconis-type variables, which are emission-line dwarfs of dKe-dMe spectral type showing quasi-periodic light changes with periods from a fraction of a day to 120 days and amplitudes from several hundredths to 0.5 mag. in V. The light variability is caused by axial rotation of a star with a variable degree of non-uniformity of the surface brightness (spots) and chromospheric activity. Some of these stars also show flares similar to those of UV Ceti stars, and in those cases they also belong to the latter type and are simultaneously considered eruptive variables. "
FALSE,Rotating,CTTS/ROT,T,Classical T Tauri stars showing periodic variability due to spots. They have extensive disks that result in strong emission lines (EW(Hα) ≥ 10Å). GCVS types INT and IT. 
FALSE,Rotating,ELL,F,"Rotating ellipsoidal variables. These are close binary systems with ellipsoidal components, which change combined brightnesses with periods equal to those of orbital motion because of changes in emitting areas toward an observer. Eclipsing binaries may also show ellipsoidal variability but the ELL objects listed in VSX are those showing no eclipses. Light amplitudes usually do not exceed 0.1 mag. in V but may reach 0.3 mag. in some cases. Examples: b Per"
FALSE,Rotating,FKCOM,F,"FK Comae Berenices-type variables. These are rapidly rotating single G and K-type giants with nonuniform surface brightnesses. Their photometric behaviour is similar to that of RS CVn systems but the absorption lines and Ca II reversals exhibit extreme rotational broadening, with a projected equatorial velocity of 100-160 km/s. They have strong magnetic activity and X-ray emission and contain the hottest coronal plasmas among active stars. Periods of light variation (up to several days) are equal to rotational periods, and amplitudes are several tenths of a magnitude. It is not excluded that these objects are the product of further evolution of W UMa close binary systems (binary coalescence). Examples: FK Com, YY Men. "
FALSE,Rotating,HB,T,"Heartbeat stars. A type of eccentric binary stars (e >0.2) whose light curves resemble a cardiogram. They are ellipsoidal variables that undergo extreme dynamic tidal forces. As the two stars pass through periastron, brightness variations occur as a consequence of tidal deformation and mutual irradiation. There may also be tidally induced pulsations present. The morphology of the photometric periastron variation (heartbeat) depends strongly on the eccentricity, inclination and argument of periastron. The amplitude of variations is very small, usually below 0.01 mag. but it may exceed 0.3 mag. in extreme cases.  "

Pulsars emit narrow beams of radiation, and periods of their light changes coincide with rotational periods (from 0.004 to 4 s), while amplitudes of the light pulses reach 0.8 mag. Example: CM Tau. "
FALSE,Rotating,R,F,"Close binary systems characterized by the presence of strong reflection (re-radiation) of the light of the hot star illuminating the surface of the cooler companion. Light curves are sinusoidal with the period equal to Porb, maximum brightness coinciding with the passage of the hot star in front of the companion. The eclipse may be absent. The range of light variation may reach 1 mag. in V. Example: KV Vel. "
FALSE,Rotating,ROT,T,"Spotted stars that weren't classified into a particular class. All the SPOTTED stars in the UNSW list and the very small amplitude spotted stars found by Kepler are included here. Also, some stars that don't fit the current subtypes due to their physical properties have been classified as such (brown dwarfs and white dwarfs with spots). It may be used as a subtype when a T Tauri star shows rotational variability (TTS/ROT, CTTS/ROT or WTTS/ROT). "
FALSE,Rotating,RS,F,"RS Canum Venaticorum-type binary systems. The primaries are usually giants from late F to late K spectral type. A significant property of these systems is the presence in their spectra of strong Ca II H and K emission lines of variable intensity, indicating increased chromospheric activity of the solar type. These systems are also characterized by the presence of radio and X-ray emission. Their light curves look like sine waves outside eclipses, with amplitudes and positions changing slowly with time. The presence of this wave (often called a distortion wave) is explained by differential rotation of the star, its surface being covered with groups of spots; the period of the rotation of a spot group is usually close to the period of orbital motion but still differs from it, which is the reason for the slow change (migration) of the phases of the distortion wave minimum and maximum in the mean light curve in the case of the eclipsing binaries (E/RS). The variability of the wave's amplitude (which may be up to 0.5 mag. in V) is explained by the existence of a long-period stellar activity cycle similar to the 11-year solar activity cycle, during which the number and total area of spots on the star's surface vary. Small amplitude flares are often observed too. "
FALSE,Rotating,SXARI,F,"SX Arietis-type variables. These are main-sequence B0p-B9p stars with variable-intensity He I and Si III lines and magnetic fields. They are sometimes called helium variables. Periods of light and magnetic field changes (about 1 day) coincide with rotational periods, while amplitudes are approximately 0.1 mag. in V. These stars are high-temperature analogs of the ACV variables. "
FALSE,Rotating,SXARI/E,T,sigma Ori E stars. Subset of the SXARI variables. Rapidly and rigidly rotating stars with strong magnetic fields that show eclipse-like dimmings probably caused by magnetospherically confined circumstellar disk material that occults the central star.
FALSE,Rotating,TTS/ROT,T,"T Tauri stars showing periodic variability due to spots, but not yet classified as Classical (CTTS/ROT) or Weak-lined (WTTS/ROT). "
FALSE,Rotating,WTTS/ROT,T,"Weak-lined T Tauri stars showing periodic variability due to spots. A T Tauri star that lacks strong emission lines in its optical spectrum (EW(Hα) < 10Å), and lacks both strong stellar winds and a circumstellar accretion disk. Also known as naked T Tauri star. GCVS types INT and IT. "
FALSE,Rotating,NSIN ELL,F,"Designation in the OGLE catalogues for stars with strictly periodic light curves, which are evidently non-sinusoidal and are likely to be ellipsoidal variables. "
FALSE,Rotating,PSR,F,Binary systems having a pulsar as the compact object that strongly irradiates a low mass companion. Example: QX Sge (E/PSR). 
FALSE,Rotating,ROT,T,"T Tauri stars showing periodic variability due to spots. For those members of this class where special features are well known, the subtype classifications of CTTS/ROT or WTTS/ROT may be applied. Where not precisely known, the subtype of TTS/ROT is used. "

FALSE,Pulsating,ACEP,T,"Anomalous Cepheids. Stars with periods characteristic of comparatively long-period RRAB variables (0.4 to 2 days), but considerably brighter by luminosity. They are more massive (1.3 to 2.2 solar masses) than RR Lyrae stars. They are metal-poor A and early F-type stars. GCVS type BLBOO. "
FALSE,Pulsating,ACYG,F,"Variables of the α Cygni type, which are non-radially pulsating supergiants of Bep-AepIa spectral types. The light changes with amplitudes of the order of 0.1 mag. often seem irregular, being caused by the superposition of many oscillations with close periods. Cycles from several days to several weeks are observed. "
FALSE,Pulsating,AHB1,T,"Above Horizontal Branch variables of subtype 1, also known as XX Vir variables. Pulsating variables with periods between 0.7 and 3 d. showing highly asymmetric light curves (rise durations <25%) of large amplitude and low metallicity ([Fe/H] <-1), crossing the instability strip from the blue to the red on their way to the AGB after helium core exhaustion. They have low masses and higher luminosities (Mv = +0.2 to -1.4; ~1 mag. brighter) than the RR Lyrae stars of the same period. There is controversy in the literature about their nomenclature. They were originally called RRD but now that designation is used for the double-mode RR Lyrae stars. They were also called ""short period type II cepheids"" and have been classified among the CWB variables but their light curves are different from the BL Her stars (which show humps in their light curves and longer rise durations) and are very similar to the light curves of RRAB-type stars with periods around 0.5 d. AHB1 stars occupy the same region in the HR-diagram as the anomalous cepheids (ACEP) but their light curves are different (1994A&A...283..111S). Some researchers (OGLE team) have explained this saying that the AHB1 variables are fundamental mode ACEP while the other ACEP with more symmetrical light curves and smaller amplitudes are supposed to be first overtone ACEP. However, AHB1 and ACEP show different evolutionary paths and masses. ACEP are more massive (1.3 - 2.2 solar masses), they are not post-HB stars and appear predominantly in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but are almost absent in Galactic globular clusters, while the AHB1 stars are absent in dwarf spheroidals but are present in globular clusters (2006ARA&A..44...93S). Examples: XX Vir, BF Ser  "
FALSE,Pulsating,BCEP,F,"Variables of the β Cephei type (β Cep, β CMa), which are non-superigiant pulsating O8-B6 stars with light and radial-velocity variations caused by low-order pressure and gravity mode pulsations. Periods are in the range of 0.1 - 0.6 days and light amplitudes go from 0.01 to 0.3 mag. in V. The light curves are similar in shape to average radial-velocity curves but lag in phase by a quarter of the period, so that maximum brightness corresponds to maximum contraction, i.e., to minimum stellar radius. The majority of these stars probably show radial pulsations, but some display nonradial pulsations; multi-periodicity is characteristic of many of these stars. Example: V469 Per. "
FALSE,Pulsating,BCEPS,F,"A short-period group of β Cep variables. The spectral types are B2-B3 IV-V; periods and light amplitudes are in the ranges 0.02 - 0.04 days and 0.015 - 0.025 days, respectively, i.e., an order of magnitude smaller than the normally observed ones. Elimination of this type proposed by GCVS. "
FALSE,Pulsating,BLAP,T,"Blue large-amplitude pulsators. Blue stars with similar temperature (~30,000 K) as hot subdwarfs but lower surface gravity, which points to the presence of inflated envelopes. They might be core helium-burning stars that suffered significant mass loss or -more likely- hydrogen shell-burning stripped red giants. They show very regular brightness variations with periods in the range of 20-40 minutes and amplitudes from 0.2 to 0.4 magnitudes in the optical passbands.

FALSE,Pulsating,CEP,F,"Cepheids. Radially pulsating, high luminosity (classes Ib-II) variables with periods in the range of 1-135 days and amplitudes from several hundredths to 2 mag. in V (in the B band, the amplitudes are greater). Spectral type at maximum light is F; at minimum, the types are G-K. The longer the period of light variation, the later is the spectral type. The maximum of the surface-layer expansion velocity almost coinciding with maximum light. There are several subtypes (see DCEP, DCEP(B), DCEPS, DCEPS(B), CWA, CWB and ACEP). Some DCEP and CW stars are quite often called Cepheids because it is often impossible to discriminate between them on the basis of the light curves for periods in the range 3 - 10 days. However, these are distinct groups of entirely different objects in different evolutionary stages. One of the significant spectral differences between W Virginis stars and Cepheids is the presence, during a certain phase interval, of hydrogen-line emission in the former and of Ca II H and K emission in the latter. "
FALSE,Pulsating,CW,F,"Variables of the W Virginis type. These are pulsating variables of the galactic spherical component (old disk) population with periods of approximately 0.8 to 35 days and amplitudes from 0.3 to 1.2 mag. in V. They obey a period-luminosity relation different from that for δ Cep variables (see DCEP). For an equal period value, the W Vir variables are fainter than the δ Cep stars by 0.7 - 2 mag. The light curves of W Vir variables for some period intervals differ from those of δ Cep variables for corresponding periods either by amplitudes or by the presence of humps on their descending branches, sometimes turning into broad flat maxima. W Vir variables are present in globular clusters and at high galactic latitudes. They may be separated into the subtypes CWA and CWB. "
FALSE,Pulsating,CWA,F,W Virginis variables with periods longer than 8 days. The longer period ones start showing different minima getting mixed with the RVA class.

FALSE,Pulsating,DCEP,F,"These are the classical Cepheids, or δ Cephei-type variables. Comparatively young objects that have left the main sequence and evolved into the instability strip of the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram, they obey the well-known Cepheid period-luminosity relation and belong to the young disk population. DCEP stars are present in open clusters. They display a certain relation between the shapes of their light curves and their periods. They are fundamental mode pulsators. "
FALSE,Pulsating,DCEP(B),T,"Classical cepheids displaying the presence of two or more simultaneously operating pulsation modes (usually the fundamental tone with the period P0 and the first overtone P1).

The shapes of the light curves, periods, and amplitudes usually vary greatly. Radial as well as non-radial pulsations are observed. The variability of some members of this type appears sporadically and sometimes completely ceases, this being a consequence of strong amplitude modulation with the lower value of the amplitude not exceeding 0.001 mag. in some cases. The maximum of the surface layer expansion does not lag behind the maximum light for more than 0.1 periods. DSCT stars are representatives of the galactic disk (flat component), SXPHE stars are halo objects. "
FALSE,Pulsating,DSCTC,F,Low-amplitude group of δ Scuti variables (light amplitude <0.1 mag. in V). The majority of this type's representatives are stars of luminosity class V; objects of this subtype generally are representative of the δ Sct variables in open clusters. This type has become obsolete in VSX since most DSCT have small amplitudes and the only clear distinction is the one between DSCT and HADS (amplitudes <0.15 mag.).

They belong to the brightest blue stars of their parent galaxies. As a rule, these stars are connected with diffuse nebulae and surrounded by expanding envelopes. Examples: P Cyg, η Car. Also known as LBV. The SDOR variability is known in the literature as an aspect of the LBV phenomenon, consisting of photospheric pulsations with time scales of hundreds to thousands of days and excursions to the redder part of the HR-diagram when the star is brighter (SDOR phases).

Subgroup of  Young Stellar Objects that show irregular variations with a wide range of amplitudes from barely detectable to more than 4 mag in V.  Most of them are Herbig Ae/Be stars but there are some T Tauri stars with later spectral types also showing the same behaviour. Large-amplitude variability is confined to stars with spectral types later than B8. There are two principal components: (1) irregular variations on time-scales of days around a mean brightness level that changes on a much longer time-scale (typically years), sometimes in a quasi-cyclic fashion, and (2) occasional episodes of deep minima, occurring at irregular intervals but more frequently near the low points of the brightness cycles. UXors show increased polarization when the optical light of the star becomes fainter (presence of clumps in our line of sight) and redder, while in extreme visual minima there is a color reversal.

The amplitude of the dips may be deeper than 1 mag. Some are quasi-periodic and some are irregular. The possible explanation for the dips involves circumstellar disks and transiting cometary-like debris."

NA,Cataclysmic,AM,F,"AM Herculis-type variables; close binary systems consisting of a dK-dM type dwarf and a superstrong magnetic white dwarf primary, in which the magnetic field of the primary not only prevents the formation of an accretion disk but also synchronizes the primary's rotation with its orbital period. They are characterized by variable linear and circular polarization of light. The total range of light variations may reach 4-5 mag. in V. Also known as polars. "
NA,Cataclysmic,CBSS,T,"Close-binary supersoft source. Super soft X-rays are believed to be produced in high luminosity close binary systems by steady nuclear burning on the surface of an accreting white dwarf (WD). Orbital periods range from 0.15 to 4 d. The high mass transfer rate has been suggested to be caused by dynamical instability, expected when the donor star is more massive than the accreting object. When the orbital period is smaller than ~6 hours, this mechanism does not work and the CBSS with such periods are believed to be fed by a distinct mechanism: the wind-driven accretion. Their spectra show high-ionization species like O VI and N V; the emission of He II λ4686 is stronger than twice the strength of Hβ. There may be indication of jets. The orbital light curve can have shapes of either double eclipse or sine wave.Examples: QR And, MR Vel.  "
NA,Cataclysmic,CBSS/V,T,"V Sagittae-type stars. They belong to the CBSS class but are not detected as supersoft X-ray emitters. In V Sge stars, lines are usually stronger and broader when compared to the rest of the CBSS but this might be a selection effect associated with chemical abundance. Environments and stars with low chemical abundance have weaker winds so supersoft X-rays can escape and not be absorbed by the interstellar medium or the stellar wind. This is the case of the Magellanic Clouds. The opposite happens in stars and environmets with high chemical abundance where the soft photons are either absorbed by the stellar wind or by the interstellar medium (or both).Examples: V Sge, WX Cen.

NA,Cataclysmic,IBWD,T,Interacting Binary White Dwarfs . Close binary systems with ultra short periods (5-70 minutes). Also known as AM CVn-type stars or Helium dwarf novae because they lack hydrogen lines in their spectra. Outbursting IBWD objects can be identified by some outburst properties: short (5-6 d.) superoutbursts (that may be double); rapid fadings but long-fading tails lasting 100-200 d. and without IR-excess; smaller amplitudes than UGWZ stars and fainter superoutburst absolute magnitudes (<4). 
NA,Cataclysmic,N,F,"Novae. Close binary systems with orbital periods from 0.05 to 230 days. One of the components of these systems is a hot white dwarf star that suddenly, during a time interval from one to several dozen or several hundred days, increases its brightness by 7-19 mag. in V, then returns gradually to its former brightness over several months, years, or decades. Small changes at minimum light may be present. Cool components may be giants, subgiants, or dwarfs of K-M type. The spectra of novae near maximum light resemble A-F absorption spectra of luminous stars at first. Then broad emission lines (bands) of hydrogen, helium, and other elements with absorption components indicating the presence of a rapidly expanding envelope appear in the spectrum. As the light decreases, the composite spectrum begins to show forbidden lines characteristic of the spectra of gas nebulae excited by hot stars. At minimum light, the spectra of novae are generally continuous or resemble the spectra of Wolf-Rayet stars. Only spectra of the most massive systems show traces of cool components. Some novae reveal pulsations of hot components with periods of approximately 100 s. and amplitudes of about 0.05 mag. in V after an outburst. Some novae eventually turn out to be eclipsing systems. According to the features of their light variations, novae are subdivided into fast (NA), slow (NB), very slow (NC), and recurrent (NR) categories. "

Here the presence of the well-known ""dip"" in the light curves of novae similar to T Aur and DQ Her is not taken into account: The rate of fading is estimated on the basis of a smooth curve, its parts before and after the ""dip"" being a direct continuation of one another. Example: RR Pic. "
NA,Cataclysmic,NC,F,"Novae with a very slow development and remaining at maximum light for more than a decade, then fading very slowly. Before an outburst these objects may show long-period light changes with amplitudes of 1-2 mag. in V; cool components of these systems are probably giants or supergiants, sometimes semi-regular variables, and even Mira variables. Outburst amplitudes may reach 10 mag. High excitation emission spectra resemble those of planetary nebulae, Wolf-Rayet stars, and symbiotic variables (they are called ""symbiotic novae""). The possibility that these objects are planetary nebulae in the process of formation is not excluded. Example: RR Tel. "
NA,Cataclysmic,NL,F,Nova-like stars. Cataclysmic variables where the mass transfer rate is above a certain limit and their accretion disks are stable because they are nearly fully ionized to their outer (tidal cut off) boundary and this condition suppresses dwarf nova outbursts. Also known as UX (UX Ursae Majoris stars). 
NA,Cataclysmic,NL/VY,T,"Anti-dwarf novae. VY Sculptoris stars. They are cataclysmic binary systems with a hot (35,000-65,000 K) and luminous white dwarf that occasionally undergo fadings of more than 1 magnitude (up to several magnitudes) due to a low rate of mass transfer. These fadings might last from days to years. At maximum they vary up to 1 magnitude. They show no outbursts even though at minimum they fall into the dwarf novae instability strip. This could be caused by the possible magnetic nature of the white dwarf. Orbital periods usually range between 0.12 and 0.18 d. Examples: VY Scl, MV Lyr. "

These objects are characterised by He-rich and H-free early-time spectra, formally leading to an SN Ib classification. They turn nebular very early, so that after 50-100 d. the ejecta seem to be transparent. They have rather low inferred ejecta masses. They are different from both SNe Ia and stripped core-collapse SNe during the nebular phase, but closer to core-collapse SNe than to SNe Ia with their Fe dominated nebular spectra.

NA,Cataclysmic,SN-pec,F,When a supernova resembles one of the types but shows different features (e.g. under-luminosity) the suffix -pec is added to the type. (SN Ib-pec) 
NA,Cataclysmic,UG,F,"U Geminorum-type variables, quite often called dwarf novae. They are close binary systems consisting of a dwarf or subgiant K-M star that fills the volume of its inner Roche lobe and a white dwarf surrounded by an accretion disk. Orbital periods are in the range 0.003-0.5 days. Usually only small, in some cases rapid, light fluctuations are observed, but from time to time the brightness of a system increases rapidly by several magnitudes and, after an interval of from several days to a month or more, returns to the original state. Intervals between two consecutive outbursts for a given star may vary greatly, but every star is characterized by a certain mean value of these intervals, i.e., a mean cycle that corresponds to the mean light amplitude. The longer the cycle, the greater the amplitude. The period given in VSX is usually the orbital period. Outburst cycles are given between parentheses. These systems are frequently sources of X-ray emission. The spectrum of a system at minimum is continuous, with broad H and He emission lines. At maximum these lines almost disappear or become shallow absorption lines. Some of these systems are eclipsing, possibly indicating that the primary minimum is caused by the eclipse of a hot spot that originates in the accretion disk from the infall of a gaseous stream from the K-M star. According to the characteristics of the light changes, U Gem variables may be subdivided into three types: SS Cyg-type (UGSS), SU UMa-type (UGSU), and Z Cam-type (UGZ). "
NA,Cataclysmic,UGER,T,ER Ursae Majoris-type subclass of UGSU dwarf novae. These stars typically spend a third of their time in super-outburst with a super-cycle of 20-90 days. Outside of super-outburst they typically pack in a rapid succession of normal outbursts. The period given in VSX is usually the orbital period. Outburst cycles are given between parentheses. Amplitudes are smaller (around 3 mag.) than in other dwarf novae due to a higher mass transfer rate. 
NA,Cataclysmic,UGSS,F,"SS Cygni-type variables. They increase in brightness by 2-6 mag. in V in 1-2 days and in several subsequent days return to their original brightnesses. The values of the cycle are in the range 10 days to several thousand. The period given in VSX is usually the orbital period. Outburst cycles are given between parentheses.  Examples: SS Cyg, U Gem. "
NA,Cataclysmic,UGSU,F,"SU Ursae Majoris-type variables. These are characterized by the presence of two types of outbursts called ""normal"" and ""super-outbursts"". Normal, short outbursts are similar to those of UGSS stars, while super-outbursts are brighter by 2 mag., are more than five times longer (wider), and occur several times less frequently. During super-outbursts the light curves show superposed periodic oscillations (super-humps), their periods being close to the orbital ones and amplitudes being about 0.2-0.3 mag. in V. Orbital periods are shorter than 0.1 days; companions are of dM spectral type. The period given in VSX is usually the orbital period. Outburst cycles are given between parentheses. "
NA,Cataclysmic,UGWZ,T,"WZ Sagittae type subclass of UGSU dwarf novae in which the interval between super-outbursts is unusually long (>4 years) due to a very low mass-transfer rate, while normal outbursts are few or absent. They show double-waved early superhumps coincident with the orbital period (as a manifestation of the 2:1 resonance) for several days at the beginning of their outbursts (the low inclination systems may show a similar period of time without variations before the onset of ordinary superhumps). They undergo re-brightenings. Orbital periods range from 0.05 to 0.08 d. Amplitudes are larger than ~7 magnitudes. "
NA,Cataclysmic,UGZ,F,"Z Camelopardalis-type stars. These also show cyclic outbursts, differing from UGSS variables by the fact that sometimes after an outburst they do not return to the original brightness, but during several cycles retain a magnitude between maximum and minimum. The values of cycles are from 10 to 40 days, while light amplitudes are from 2 to 5 mag. in V. The period given in VSX is usually the orbital period. Outburst cycles are given between parentheses. "
NA,Cataclysmic,UGZ/IW,T,"IW And stars. Also known as anomalous Z Cam stars. A subset of the UGZ class. They show outbursts arising from standstills and eclipsing-like light curves.  Examples: IW And, V0513 Cas"
NA,Cataclysmic,V838MON,T,"Luminous red transients of the V838 Monocerotis type that become redder in outburst and are thought to be the result of the merger of a contact binary. After the outburst they get hidden in a dusty disk. The amplitudes are 9-13 mag. Also known as Luminous Red Novae (LNR). Examples: V838 Mon, V1309 Sco, V4332 Sgr. "
NA,Cataclysmic,WDP,T,"White dwarf pulsars. Binary systems with a rapidly rotating white dwarf that is highly magnetized (up to 500 MG). Magnetic interactions between the two component stars, coupled with synchrotron radiation from the white dwarf, power the observed polarized and non-polarized emission.  Example: AR Sco."
NA,Cataclysmic,ZAND,F,"Symbiotic variables of the Z Andromedae type. They are close binaries consisting of a hot star, a star of late type, and an extended envelope excited by the hot star's radiation. The combined brightness displays irregular variations with amplitudes up to 4 mag. in V. A very inhomogeneous group of objects. "
NA,Cataclysmic,CV,F,Cataclysmic Variables of unspecified type. 
NA,Cataclysmic,IBWD,T,Interacting Binary White Dwarfs. Close binary systems with ultra short periods (5-70 minutes).  Also known as AM CVn-type stars or Helium dwarf novae because they lack hydrogen lines in their spectra. Outbursting IBWD objects can be identified by some outburst properties: short (5-6 d.) superoutbursts (that may be double); rapid fadings but long-fading tails lasting 100-200 d. and without IR-excess; smaller amplitudes than UGWZ stars and fainter superoutburst absolute magnitudes (<4). 
NA,Cataclysmic,V,T,"V Sge subtype of the CBSS variables. They belong to the CBSS class but are not detected as supersoft X-ray emitters. In V Sge stars, lines are usually stronger and broader when compared to the rest of the CBSS but this might be a selection effect associated with chemical abundance. Environments and stars with low chemical abundance have weaker winds so supersoft X-rays can escape and not be absorbed by the interstellar medium or the stellar wind. This is the case of the Magellanic Clouds. The opposite happens in stars and environmets with high chemical abundance where the soft photons are either absorbed by the stellar wind or by the interstellar medium (or both).  Examples: V Sge, WX Cen. "
NA,Cataclysmic,VY,T,"VY Scl subtype. They are cataclysmic binary systems with a hot (35,000-65,000 K) and luminous white dwarf that occasionally undergo fadings of more than 1 magnitude (up to several magnitudes) due to a low rate of mass transfer. These fadings might last from days to years. At maximum they vary up to 1 magnitude. They are usually nova-like variables that show no outbursts but some dwarf nnovae also show similar fadings. Orbital periods usually range between 0.12 and 0.18 d. Examples: VY Scl, MV Lyr."
NA,X-ray,HMXB,T,"High Mass X-ray Binaries. Systems with a massive star (usually an O or B star, a Be star or a blue supergiant) and a compact object (generally a neutron star, a black hole or a white dwarf). A fraction of the stellar wind of the normal star is captured by the compact object and produces X-rays as it falls onto it or onto an accretion disk that's surrounding it. In X-ray binaries, the subtypes indicate which kind of behavior the binary displays, like X-ray bursts (XB), large amplitude outbursts also in the visual (XN), reflection effect (XR) or it may also inform about the object's nature, e.g.: if the compact object is a pulsar (XP). Refer to the subtypes list below. "
NA,X-ray,IMXB,T,"Intermediate-mass X-ray binaries. Binary systems where a compact object – black hole (BH), neutron star (NS) or white dwarf (WD) – is accreting matter from a companion star of spectral type A or F. IMXBs are rarely observe because when the companion is more massive than the accretor but not massive enough to have strong winds, wind accretion proceeds at a very low rate and Roche lobe accretion is thought to be unstable. For NSs and WDs in IMXBs mass flows from the more massive to the lighter star and angular momentum conservation shrinks the orbit, leading to enhanced mass transfer. The bright XRB phase is therefore intense and short lived."
NA,X-ray,LMXB,T,"Low Mass X-ray Binaries. Systems where one of the components is either a black hole or a neutron star. The other, donor, component usually fills its Roche lobe and therefore transfers mass to the compact object. The donor can be a normal dwarf, a white dwarf, or an evolved star (red giant). X-rays are emitted as the mass falls onto the compact object or onto an accretion disk that's surrounding it. The X-ray emission is incident upon the atmosphere of the cooler companion of the compact object and is reradiated in the form of optical high-temperature radiation (reflection effect), thus making that area of the cooler companion's surface an earlier spectral type. These effects lead to quite a peculiar complex character of optical variability in such systems. In X-ray binaries, the subtypes indicate which kind of behavior the binary displays, like X-ray bursts (XB), large amplitude outbursts also in the visual (XN), reflection effect (XR) or it may also inform about the object's nature, e.g.: if the compact object is a pulsar (XP). Refer to the subtypes list below. "
NA,X-ray,X,F,"Sources of strong, variable X-ray emission which do not belong to or are not yet attributed to any other type of variable stars. Most of the X-type variables turn out to be HMXB, IMXB, LMXB, AM or DQ-type binary systems. The subtypes of HMXB and LMXB systems are listed in the subtypes section. "
NA,X-ray,BHXB,T,"Black Hole X-ray Binaries. Interacting binary systems where X-rays are produced by material accreting from a secondary companion star onto a black hole (BH) primary through an accretion disk. Most of them (the transient sources) are a subtype of the LMXB but there are also some HMXB that are BHXB (usually the persistent sources, which spend most of their time in an X-ray bright state). They show outbursts as a consequence of instabilities developing in the accretion disk that cause more rapid mass transfer onto the BH and lead to bright X-ray emission. They also get brighter in the optical bands by several magnitudes. Example: V0404 Cyg"
NA,X-ray,XB,F,"X-ray bursters. Close binary systems showing X-ray and optical bursts, their duration being from several seconds to ten minutes, with amplitudes of about 0.1 mag. in V. Examples: V801 Ara, V926 Sco. "
NA,X-ray,XJ,F,"X-ray binaries characterized by the presence of relativistic jets evident at X-ray and radio wavelengths, as well as in the optical spectrum in the form of emission components showing periodic displacements with relativistic velocities. Examples: V1343 Aql"
NA,X-ray,XN,F,X-ray systems that occasionally rapidly increase in brightness by 1-9 mag. in V simultaneously with the X-ray range. 
NA,X-ray,XP,F,X-ray pulsar systems. The primary component is usually an ellipsoidal early-type supergiant. The reflection effect is very small and light variability is mainly caused by the ellipsoidal primary component's rotation. Periods of light changes are between 1 and 10 days; the period of the pulsar in the system is from 1 s. to 100 min. Light amplitudes usually do not exceed several tenths of a magnitude. Example: GP Vel. 
NA,X-ray,XPR,F,X-ray pulsar (XP) systems featuring the presence of the reflection effect. The mean light of the system is brightest when the primary component is irradiated by X rays; it is faintest during a low state of the X-ray source. The total light amplitude may reach 2-3 mag. in V. Example: HZ Her. 
NA,X-ray,XBR,F,X-ray bursters (XB) featuring the presence of the reflection effect. Example: V801 Ara. 
NA,Others,AGN,T,Active Galactic Nuclei. Optically variable extragalactic objects only included for historical reasons or observing campaigns. GCVS type GAL. 
NA,Others,BLLAC,F,"Extragalactic BL Lacertae-type objects. These are compact quasi-stellar objects showing almost continuous spectra with weak emission and absorption lines and relatively rapid irregular light changes with amplitudes up to 3 mag. in V or more. Sources of strong X-ray radiation and radio waves, their emission displays strong and variable linear polarization in the visible and infrared spectral regions. "
NA,Others,GRB,T,"Optical counterparts of gamma ray bursts (GRBs). Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several minutes. The initial burst is usually followed by a longer-lived ""afterglow"" emitted at longer wavelengths."
NA,Others,TDE,T,"Tidal disruption event. Flare of electromagnetic radiation observed when a star approaches sufficiently close to a supermassive black hole in an active galaxy nucleus and is pulled apart by the black hole's tidal forces, with a fraction of its mass being captured into an accretion disk around the black hole. In the case of a partial TDE, the star survives the encounter with the SMBH and only a fraction of the stellar material is tidally stripped, leaving the stellar core intact. Partial TDEs can repeat, causing episodic mass transfer from the star to the SMBH at every pericenter passage, resulting in a series of low-level flares that repeat on the orbital timescale. Example: ASASSN-14ko."
NA,Others,QSO,F,Optically variable quasi-stellar extragalactic sources (quasars) that earlier were erroneously considered  to be variable stars. 
NA,Others,Microlens,F,"Microlensing event. Symmetric brightening of a star caused by the presence of a separate gravitational influence intervening in line of sight. It may last from seconds to years. Microlensing events, which are a kind of extrinsic variables that, like supernovae, are a once in a lifetime event, and the star won't be observed as variable again. Example: GSC 03656-01328. "
NA,Others,*,F,"Unique variable stars outside the range of the classifications. These probably represent either short stages of transition from one variability type to another or the earliest and latest evolutionary stages of these types, or they are insufficiently studied members of future new types of variables.

NA,Others,PER,F,"Periodic variable of unspecified type. Used in the OGLE catalogues for stars with a dominating periodicity, but showing also amplitude and/or phase changes or the periodic changes superimposed on the variability on a longer rime-scale. A majority of semi-regular variables fall into this category. "
